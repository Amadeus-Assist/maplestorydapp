A simple html5 adventure game finished in last winter holiday in my college life.


## Description
This is a demo of the cool 2d online game [__MapleStory__](http://mxd.sdo.com/web6/home/index.asp), and all the resources come from [MapleSimulator](http://www.maplesimulator.com/).

This game may be not so cool, there are also some bugs, especially in the loading scene, if the progress stay a long time, please refresh. If I have time, I would recontruct it.
